# Jetson ( Nano ) Initialize 

You can use it to initialize the jetson (nano)

### Create an initialized system by my sh (My own habits)

1. Flash Jetson Nano following the [Getting Started Guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit)

    > For Jetson TX2 / Xavier, use the [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) SDK manager

2. On the Jetson, run the JetCard installation script

    ```bash
    https://github.com/Vicwxy9/Jetson-Init
    cd Jetson-Init
    # chmod +x ./init.sh
    ./init.sh
    ```


###### The project is learning from [Jetcard](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard)
